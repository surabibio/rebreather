**During Oxygen Shortage**

The second COVID19 surge has resulted in half-a-million deaths with estimates of surpassing 1 million

deaths by August 1st, 2021. The surge has strained the healthcare system in India leading to hospitals

running out of oxygen supply.

An approach to recirculate exhaled oxygen during utilization would be tremendously impactful as a

means of alleviating the oxygen shortage.

We performed a benchmark study to test the gas utilization on a volunteer.

Oxygen Flow (LPM)

We found significant increase in work of breathing as per clinical observation and volunteer feedback

but due our limited setup we are not able to quantify in absolute terms. However this was not to a level

of discomfort that mandated removal of device.

We did a post exercise test (respiratory rate 25 BPM and clinically observed tidal volume of about 2L)

and found that with the system was able to sustain the respiratory needs of the volunteer.

Long term ventilation for 6 hrs using 2LPM medical air did not product any discomfort nor clinical signs

of hypercapnia. Hence we are confident that 2kg Sodalime CO2 scrubber is able to wash out CO2 in the

circuit to normal breathable levels.

We are confident this device would be effective on patients on non-rebreather and standard oxygen

masks. The savings in oxygen could be 15 fold. A B type cylinder that lasts for 1 hour on a non-

rebreather mask can be extended to 15 hours using this rebreather.
